# Version Control

## Course Description

In this course we will learn how modern software developers collaborate across the world without messing up each other's code. We will look at the different version control systems and how to create an effective software development workflow. We will be introduced to some of the most commonly used Linux commands that we can use to work with files on our hard drive and create powerful workflows that will automate our work, saving us time and effort. 

Finally, we will see how Git can be used in software development projects to manage team files. And we will create a repository that can manage code revisions.

#### Module1: Software colaboration

In this module, we will learn about how modern software developers collaborate across the world without messing up each other's code. This involves using version control or subversion to bring order to the chaos of massive software projects that have the potential for mistakes and bugs. We will look at the different version control systems and how to create an effective software development workflow.

After completing this module, we will be able to:

- Describe how modern software teams collaborate and work on the same codebase.
- List different version control systems and methodologies.
- Illustrate a standard software development workflow.

#### Module2: Command Line
In this module we will learn how to use the command line to execute commands in Linux. We will be introduced to some of most commonly used commands that traverse, create, rename, and delete files on your hard drive. We will learn how easy it is to use piping and redirection to create powerful workflows that will automate our work, saving us time and effort.

After completing this module, we will be able to:

- Describe how the command line is and how it is used.
- Practice traversing your hard drive via the command line.
- Create, rename and delete files and folders on your hard drive using Unix commands.
- Use pipes and redirection.

#### Module3: Working with Git
This module will help us to develop a strong conceptual understanding of the Git technology and how it is used in software development projects to manage team files. We will install Git, create a local repository, create a commit, create a remote repository and push commits to a remote repository.

After completing this module, we will be able to:

- Outline the Git principles.
- Use a GitHub repository.
- Describe the steps in a standard GitHub workflow.
- Create branches and merge different branches and sources.
- Describe how code goes from local development to version control and then to live production.

#### Module4: Graded assessment

In this module, we will be assessed on the key skills covered in the Course.

After completing this module, we will be able to:

- Apply the skills and knowledge from this course on Version Control in a practical assessment

## Next Steps

I will continue with the next course in the series: **HTML and CSS in depth**, where I’ll use software development tools like HTML to build attractive web pages that work well—and I’ll use structured semantic data to control how websites appear to the end user. 

I will then dive deeper into CSS by applying increasingly specific styling to various elements. I’ll learn to use Bootstrap’s grid system to create layouts and work with components and themes. Finally, I’ll explore debugging and learn how it can be utilized to banish common front-end errors.
